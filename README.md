# Project 2: What does community mean to us? - By Michael Cruz

# Project Overview -
## The project overiew is to create an animation through text woth either a poem or a song, and make it into a kind of image through using text and words. Connect this with what community means to you


# Technical Overview - 
### For the animation and transition, I want to make it into wings and making it into a shape of a bird. The half wing is going to be animated first, then it would transition into another wing mirror'd. All the text will be based on the poem "Dreams" by Langston Hughes.
